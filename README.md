OracleDB_Project
================

The final project for CINS 570 - Advanced Databases.  The front end is Ubuntu 14.04, Apache2, and PHP5.  
The back end is Oracle 11g.  It contains a few views, sequences, triggers, etc.  It is mostly to demonstrate 
what was learned over the semester.  The front end is very basic and not meant to be "production ready".
